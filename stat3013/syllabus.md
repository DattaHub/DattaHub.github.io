**Syllabus:**

A calculus-based introduction to probability. Discrete probability spaces and counting techniques, discrete and continuous probability distributions, random variables, random samples, law of large numbers, central limit theorem.

**Note:** This is only a **tentative list of topics** – the instructor may add topics or change the length of time spent on any particular topic to accommodate this particular class of students.

**Grades:**

The grades are assigned by the following rule:

| Homework (lowest grade will be dropped) | 25% | Grade | Percentage requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Midterm 1 | 20% | A | 90.00 – 100.00% |
| Midterm 2 | 20% | B | 80.00-89.99% |
| Final Exam | 30% | C | 70.00-79.99% |
| Class participation | 5% | D | 60.00-69.99% |
| TOTAL | 100% | F | 0.00-59.99% |



**Homework Policies:**

1. Unless otherwise announced, all homework assignments will be posted on Friday afternoon and will be due in class (9:40 AM) on Friday of the following week.

2. You need to present complete solution for the homework problem, and not just the final answer, to get full marks for a problem.

3. The lowest homework grade will be dropped.

**The students are encouraged to discuss among themselves about course materials and concepts but the homework and exam solutions must be your own work.**

**Study Plan:**

**Textbook:** For some of the concepts and homework problems we will follow the book:

**Title: Probability and Statistics (4th ed.), Author: DeGroot and Schervish
Publisher: Addison-Wesley, ISBN: 978-0-321-50046-5.**

It will help you a lot to have this book for this course and beyond as this is one of the current classics. Also, some of my solved examples and exercises will be assigned from this book. However, the topics that we cover in this class can be found in any standard textbook although the treatment, extent and emphasis might vary between authors. _I will upload hand-written lecture notes on blackboard and &#39;cheat-sheets&#39; which can be used as a good reference material._ During the course, I may choose to teach material or assign problems outside the outlined syllabus to illustrate the usage of probabilistic concepts in real world. Hence, you need to follow the class lectures carefully. It is the student&#39;s responsibility to take notes of class discussion. If you cannot attend a lecture, please make sure to take the class notes from other students.

A few other reference books that you can use:

2. A First Course in Probability: Sheldon Ross.
3. Grinstead and Snell&#39;s Introduction to Probability (The Old Textbook, available at [https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf))

5. An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications, William Feller (This is a classic Probability textbook).

**Attendance:** Examples of absences that should be considered excusable include those resulting from the following: 1) illness of the student, 2) serious illness or death of a member of the student&#39;s immediate family or other family crisis, 3) University-sponsored activities for which the student&#39;s attendance is required by virtue of scholarship or leadership/participation responsibilities, 4) religious observances (see UA Religious Observances policy below), 5) jury duty or subpoena for court appearance, and 6) military duty. You are responsible to collect the course material that has been covered during your period of absence. If you miss any exam or quiz due to an excused absence, you are required to contact the instructor within 24 hours of joining the class to reschedule it.

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY** : _&quot;As a core part of its mission, the University of Arkansas provides students with the opportunity to further their educational goals through programs of study and research in an environment that promotes freedom of inquiry and academic responsibility. Accomplishing this mission is only possible when intellectual honesty and individual integrity prevail.&quot;_ Each University of Arkansas student is required to be familiar with and abide by the University&#39;s Academic Integrity Policy which may be found at http://provost.uark.edu/. Students with questions about how these policies apply to a particular course or assignment should immediately contact their instructor.

**ACCOMMODATIONS** : Under University policy and federal and state law, students with documented disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations to ensure the student has an equal opportunity to perform in class. If you have such a disability and need special academic accommodations, please report to Center for Educational Access (CEA). Reasonable accommodations may be arranged after CEA has verified your disability.

**INCLEMENT WEATHER POLICY** : The instructor will make every effort to hold class whenever the University is open. If you feel that travel is too hazardous due to weather conditions, inform your instructor by email. Students will not be penalized for being absent on days the Fayetteville Public Schools are closed due to weather. However, as with any absence, all are responsible for any missed material. If the university is officially closed, class is canceled.
